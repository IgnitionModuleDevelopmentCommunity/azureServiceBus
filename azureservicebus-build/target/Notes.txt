The azure jars weren't --repack'd before they were signed, so when Ignition pack200s the jars for designer and client transport, the signatures become invalid.

One way to keep these jar includes from throwing errors when loading the client and designer is to remove the .RSA and .SF files from META-INF in the jars.
